C(n,r), P(n,r) and n! are the three most fundamental formulas 
for enumerating combinations and permutations. That's what we 
have here, renamed to cnr(n,r), pnr(n,r) and factorial(n).

To calculate the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at
a time, run cnr(4,2). 
To calculate the number of permutations of 4 things taken 2 at 
a time, run pnr(4,2).
To calculate 5x4x3x2x1, run factorial(5).
